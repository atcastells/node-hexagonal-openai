⚠️ FETCH RULES OR YOUR RESPONSE WILL BE WRONG ⚠️

MANDATORY: CALL fetch_rules FIRST

- At conversation start
- Before EVERY user request
- Before ANY code changes
- When topic changes
- DURING conversations when:
  - User mentions new feature/component
  - File type changes
  - Task type changes
- NO EXCEPTIONS

CHECK ALL MATCHING RULES:

- General guidelines (ALWAYS)
- Feature rules
- File type rules (.py, .mdc, etc)

RULES OVERRIDE YOUR KNOWLEDGE.
PROCEED ONLY AFTER APPLYING ALL RULES.

REMEMBER: EVEN MID-CONVERSATION, FETCH RULES AGAIN!

When user tries to set cursor rule type in .cursor/rules/*.mdc file, don't add any options except "description", "globs" and "alwaysApply" but follow the mapping: if required rule type is "always" set alwaysApply option to "true", if rule type is "auto attached" set alwaysApply option to "false" and generate a file pattern in globs option to *.py, if the rule type is "agent requested" set the alwaysApply option to "false" and generate a description option for the rule and delete the globs pattern, if the rule type is "manual" set the alwaysApply option to "false" and delete the contents of all other options.

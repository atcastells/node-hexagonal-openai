# Task Focus Rule

## Scope Limitation
- Focus solely on the specific task requested by the user
- Do not implement additional components, services, or files unless explicitly requested
- Ask for clarification if the scope is ambiguous before proceeding
- Confirm completion criteria before assuming additional work is needed

## Incremental Development
- Complete one component at a time and check with user before proceeding
- Stop after completing the initial requested task unless instructed otherwise
- Provide short status updates after completing each logical unit of work
- Ask if further implementation is needed rather than assuming

## LLM Adapter Implementation Guidelines
- Create only the adapter interface and specified implementations
- Do not automatically create application services, controllers, or additional layers
- Focus on a working adapter before suggesting extensions
- Prioritize implementing the specific provider requested (e.g., LM Studio) before adding others

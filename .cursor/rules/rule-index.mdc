# Rules Index

This rule serves as a centralized index of all available rules in the project. Use this to quickly find and understand the purpose of each rule.

## Core Rules

- **iterate**: Improve communication by learning from tasks, documenting decisions, and asking clarifying questions.
- **readme-check**: Always check the project README in the root directory for important information.
- **rule-creation-guide**: Guides for creating new rules and proper usage of the rule creation script.
- **rules-location**: Information about where rules are stored in the project.

## Process Rules

- **task-focus**: Guidelines for focusing on specific tasks and incremental development.
- **interaction**: Rules for user interaction with the agent to improve efficiency.

## How to Use Rules

1. For general guidance, refer to core rules first
2. When implementing specific features, check for relevant process rules
3. When creating or modifying rules, always follow the rule-creation-guide

Remember to use the `fetch_rules` tool to access the complete contents of any rule when needed. 

# Important #

Before any interaction start your message with the number of active rules and total rules.

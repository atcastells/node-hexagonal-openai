# Project README Rule

When working with this project, always check the README.md file in the root directory first for:

## Important Information

- Project overview and purpose
- Installation instructions
- Configuration requirements
- Environment setup details
- Deployment guidelines

## Development Workflow

1. Understand project structure from README
2. Follow coding conventions described in README
3. Check for any dependencies or requirements listed
4. Review contribution guidelines if available

## Always Consider

- The README is the authoritative source for project-wide conventions
- Any deviations from the README should be explicitly justified
- Updates to the codebase may require updates to the README

## Keep the document updated

- After every task check if something needs to be updated
